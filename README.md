PEDevTracker
=============

Introduction
-------------

An ASP.NET MVC4 / C# developer tracker for Pillars of Eternity. 

The goal of this project is to provide a clear, easy to use and centralized location to monitor Obsidian's developers posts on the official boards.
I made it open source so people willing to add extra sources can do it. This is hosted on Windows Azure (free subscription) so there is no advertisement or anything.

Since this is hosted on Azure, the project use SQL Server Express an Azure SDK. It was developed using VS Studio Express 2013 for Web.

Other dependencies include Bootstrap, jQuery and Fluent NHibernate.
